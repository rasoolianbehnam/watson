ABSTRACT
Motivation: Searching for structural similarity is a key issue of
protein functional annotation. The maximum contact map overlap
(CMO) is one of the possible measures of protein structure similarity.
Exact and approximate methods known to optimize the CMO are
computationally expensive and this hampers their applicability to
large-scale comparison of protein structures.
Results: In this article, we describe a heuristic algorithm (Al-Eigen)
for ﬁnding a solution to the CMO problem. Our approach relies on the
approximation of contact maps by eigendecomposition. We obtain
good overlaps of two contact maps by computing the optimal global
alignment of few principal eigenvectors. Our algorithm is simple, fast
and its running time is independent of the amount of contacts in the
map. Experimental testing indicates that the algorithm is comparable
to exact CMO methods in terms of the overlap quality, to structural
alignment methods in terms of structure similarity detection and it
is fast enough to be suited for large-scale comparison of protein
structures. Furthermore, our preliminary tests indicates that it is
quite robust to noise, which makes it suitable for structural similarity
detection also for noisy and incomplete contact maps.

INTRODUCTION

Measuring the similarity of protein structures is a necessary step in
several problems of bioinformatics, including the determination of
structure conservation through evolution across species and/or the
relation among structure and function. Several similarity measures
of protein structures are available albeit no general agreement on
the best one has been achieved (Godzik, 1996; Oakley et al., 2008;
Sadreyev et al., 2009). Routinely, each similarity measure relies
on the choice of a scoring function and on the assumption that its
optimum corresponds to the best possible match between two protein
structures.
The most widely adopted scoring measures are based on the
root mean square deviation (RMSD; Kabasch, 1976), distance map
similarity (Holm and Sander, 1993), contact map overlap (CMO;

Godzik et al., 1992) and, recently, universal similarity metric (UMS;
Krasnogor and Pelta, 2004; Rahmati and Glasgow, 2009). The
maximum CMO measure quantifies the level of similarity between
two protein structures by measuring the maximum overlap of their
contact maps and it is obtained by computing the sequence alignment
that maximizes the number of corresponding contacts between pairs
of aligned residues. The maximum CMO is one of the few measures
for which exact algorithms are known. On the other hand, the
maximum CMO problem is known to be NP hard (Goldman et al.,
1999).
Although not explicitly stated in previous papers dealing with
CMO algorithms, the goal of the these tools is to address the problem
of protein structure prediction. In practice, given a set of predicted
contacts the basic idea is to look for the best possible physical
contact map among the available ones by means of a CMO program:
methods for contact prediction are presently not accurate enough
(Ezkurdia et al., 2009) to allow protein structure reconstruction
(Vassura et al., 2008). The main contribution of CMO algorithms
is therefore to provide tools for template recognition when the
native protein structure is unknown and not to substitute structural
alignment methods (i.e. methods based on RMSD and distance map
similarity measures), which perform quite well.
The first exact algorithm for the maximum CMO problem, based
on integer programming (IP), was developed in Lancia et al. (2001)
and improved in Caprara and Lancia (2002). Later, several other
methods based on the same approach were proposed (Andonov
et al., 2008; Strickland et al., 2005; Xie and Sahinidis, 2007). The
IP approach consists in formulating the CMO as the maximization
of some integer linear function and solving it with Lagrangian
Relaxation (LR) and/or Branch and Bound reduction techniques. The
disadvantage of IP-based methods is that, due to the intractability of
the problem, they are exponential in the worst case. For a practical
usage, the running time of these algorithms is bounded and the
best solution within the time limit is returned. The counter part is
that the IP-based methods provide upper and lower bounds to the
optimal solution and this makes it possible to evaluate the quality of
the partial solution from the distance between the upper and lower
bound. The best possible overlap is found when the upper and lower
bounds coincide. Recently, two polynomial-time approximation
schemes for the protein structure alignment problem (in particular,
contact map alignment) have been developed (Agarwal et al., 2007;
Xu et al., 2007). The approximation algorithm described in Xu et al.
(2007) is polynomial in the protein length but it is exponential with
respect to some constant parameters and its running time increases
with decrease of an approximation factor. The method developed

Fast overlapping of protein contact maps by alignment of eigenvectors

in Agarwal et al. (2007) is based on a decomposition procedure on
the input graphs. It is a six-approximation algorithm, i.e. it returns a
solution that is at least 1/6 distant from the optimal one, and it has
a polynomial running time.
Despite the strength of the underlying formalization, the
CMO-based algorithms are scarcely used to compare protein
structures. Indeed, the algorithmic implementations of the exact and
approximation methods are on the average too slow to be used for
wide-scale comparison. Furthermore and most importantly, there
is no agreement on the most suitable value of contact threshold
to represent a protein structure (Caprara et al., 2004; Duarte
et al., 2010; Vassura et al., 2008). High-threshold contact maps
(≥10 Å) are more informative; however, their comparison requires
an even higher computational time and this makes the adoption of
exact/approximation methods not feasible.
To our knowledge, only three heuristic methods, SADP (Jain and
Lappe, 2007), MSVNS (Pelta et al., 2008) and BIMAL (Jain and
Obermayer, 2009), have been proposed for the CMO problem. Even
if not optimal, SADP, MSVNS and BIMAL can produce acceptable
solutions in a reasonable time compared with exact methods. The
main limitation of available heuristic CMO methods is that their
running time depends on the number of contacts making them
extremely slow when the contact maps contain a huge number of
contacts.
In this article, we describe a new heuristic algorithm for the
CMO problem. Our approach is based on the property that a
contact map can be well-approximated by few of its eigenvectors.
Thus, an acceptable overlapping of two contact maps can be
heuristically obtained by performing a global alignment of few
eigenvectors. The exploitation of the eigenvalues and eigenvector
properties of the graph adjacency matrices have been extensively
investigated in the more general context of inexact graph matching.
In the pioneering work by Umeyama (1988), lately improved in
Zhao et al. (2007), the eigendecomposition is introduced to detect
a near-optimal permutation matrix that maximizes the similarity
between two labeled graphs of the same size. The limitation on
the graph dimensions is overcome in more recent approaches, such
as Luo and Hancock (2001) and Singh et al. (2007), where the
eigendecomposition is used to detect local similarities between
the neighborhood topologies of the nodes in the two graphs. A
different approach that exploits eigendecomposition is based on the
conversion of a graph into a string by using the ordering of the
nodes as defined by the principal eigenvector of its adjacency matrix
(Robles-Kelly and Hancock, 2002). By this, two graphs can be
matched by computing an alignment that minimizes the edit distance
between the corresponding strings. However, these approaches,
differently from the CMO methods, do not require to preserve the
ordering of the nodes in the adjacency matrices. Differently, in
our method the eigendecomposition is used to transform the twodimensional alignment problem between contact maps into a onedimensional alignment problem between eigenvectors. Therefore,
in our case, the ordering between the nodes in the maps is
naturally imposed by the one-dimensional alignment between their
eigenvectors.
Our algorithm is easily implementable and fast. Noticeably, by
design, its running time does not depend on the number of contacts
contained in the map and thus on the contact threshold. Experimental
results show that it can compute good overlaps compared with exact
CMO methods and that its performances in terms of protein structure

recognition/classification are comparable with those of structural
alignment methods. The running time of our implementation is
comparable with the fastest structural alignment algorithms and
heuristic CMO methods. Our tests confirm that contact maps
computed at thresholds values ≥10 Å are more informative of the
protein structures than those at lower thresholds and this makes
our algorithm more suitable than other available CMO methods
for protein structure comparison on large scale. Furthermore, in
order to evaluate the robustness our algorithm, we test the effect
of random noise on the accuracy of structural similarity recognition
performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
a CMO algorithm is evaluated in this way. The experimental tests
indicate that our method is quite robust and can tolerate high amount
of noise without dramatically affecting its recognition capabilities.

BACKGROUND

2.1

Contact maps

A protein contact map is a two-dimensional approximation of the
protein three-dimensional structure. For a given protein P, its contact
map of threshold τ is a square binary symmetric matrix defined by

MijP =

1 if the distance between residues i,j is ≤ τÅ
0 otherwise

There are several definitions of distance between residues in
literature. The particular choice of a distance is not critical since
the CMO problem is independent of the distance used to represent
contacts between residues.
Following the CMO literature, we consider here the Cα distance,
which defines the distance between residues i,j as the Euclidean
distance between the coordinates of their respective Cα atoms.
Typical threshold values for Cα contact maps vary from 6 Å to
16 Å. For this range of thresholds, consecutive residues are always in
contact (consecutive residues share a peptide bond and the distance
between their respective Cα atoms is about 3.7 Å). For low-threshold
values, typically 6–9 Å, the number of contacts (i.e. 1s) observed
in the map is sparse compared with the number of non-contacts
(i.e. 0s). Moreover, these threshold values are the ones which
minimize the distance between Cα contact maps and physical contact
maps (Bartoli et al., 2007). On the contrary, high-threshold contact
maps (10–16 Å) have a higher number of contacts and are more
informative about the protein structure. At low-threshold values,
several different three-dimensional structures can be consistent with
the same contact map: the ambiguity can be minimized by increasing
the threshold of the contact map (Duarte et al., 2010; Vassura et al.,
2008). The threshold problem was also noticed in Caprara et al.
(2004), the authors report that a threshold value smaller than 7 Å is
not suitable to represent the protein structures in their benchmark set.

2.2 The maximum CMO problem
Given two proteins P1 ,P2 , whose (ordered) sets of residues are
denoted, respectively, by R1 = {1,...,n} and R2 = {1,...,m}, an
alignment between P1 and P2 is a mapping f : R1 → R2 that respects
the following two conditions:
(1) f is an injective partial function; and

P.Di Lena et al.

(2) for each pair of residues i,j ∈ R1 in the domain of f (i.e. f (i) =
∅ = f (j)) we have that
i < j if and only if f (i) < f (j).
Condition 1 imposes that a residue in the first/second protein
can be aligned at most with one (possibly none) residue in the
second/first protein. The non-aligned residues are assumed to be
matched with gaps. Biologically, the introduction of a gap reflects an
insertion/deletion event during the evolution of protein sequences.
The number of gaps in an alignment f is defined by
gapf = |{i | i ∈ R1 ,f (i) = ∅}|+|{i | i ∈ R2 ,f −1 (i) = ∅}|.

f (i)=∅=f (j)
j>i+1,f (j)>f (i)+1

Noticeably, since contacts between consecutive amino acids are
always present, they are not counted in (1). Moreover, a match
between a contact and a non-contact is not penalized in (1).
The CMO can be used as a measure of the similarity between two
proteins structures: the higher the overlap between two contact maps,
the higher the probability that the two related protein structures are
similar. The CMO measure is quite robust to perturbations and does
not greatly penalize the insertion of gaps and deletions. The CMO
as similarity measure was introduced in Godzik et al. (1992). The
problem of computing the maximum CMO was proven to be NP
hard in Goldman et al. (1999). To quantify the level of similarity
of two overlapped contact maps, we use the most widely adopted
scoring function, originally proposed in Xie and Sahinidis (2007):

Datasets

In order to compare our results with those published before, we use
the protein sets previously described. In practice, we use five different
datasets (see Table 1 and the Supplementary Material) for three different
tests: performance comparison with exact and heuristic CMO methods
(Section 4.1), recognition and classification performance comparison
with structural alignment methods (Section 4.2) and error tolerance test
(Section 4.3).
For the comparison with exact CMO methods, we refer to the results
published in Andonov et al. (2008) on the Skolnick dataset. The contact
maps used in Andonov et al. (2008) have been computed at 7.5 Å threshold
and are available as Supplementary Material.
For the comparison with heuristic CMO methods, we refer to the results
published in Jain and Obermayer (2009) on the Sokol, Lancia, Skolnick and
Fischer datasets. These datasets are usually adopted as standard benchmark

to evaluate overlap quality of CMO algorithms. The maps for the Skolnick,
Lancia and Sokol datasets used in Jain and Obermayer (2009) are available as
Supplementary Material of Xie and Sahinidis (2007). The contact threshold
used to compute these maps is not reported but it seems to be lower than
7.5 Å. The maps for the Fischer dataset are not publicly available; thus, we
computed our maps at threshold 7.5 Å for this test.
For the comparison with structural alignment methods and for testing the
error tolerance of our method, we use the Fischer and Proteus300 datasets,
which contain medium–large protein domains and are more varying with
respect to the SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008) classification than the other
benchmarks considered. The 68 domains in the Fischer dataset are distributed
in 56 distinct SCOP families, 44 distinct super families and 40 distinct folds.
Among them, 22 domains belong to a non-unique family (i.e. for each one
of them there is in the dataset at least one representative in the same family
class), five have one representative in the same fold class but not in the same
family/s.family classes and 22 domains belong to a unique fold class. The
300 domains in the Proteus300 dataset are distributed in 30 distinct SCOP
families (10 domains per family), 27 distinct super families and 24 folds. For
the recognition/classification experiments, we test several different threshold
values. For all the other experiments, we use contact maps at threshold 7.5 Å
(or lower).

3.2 Al-eigen implementation
The maximum CMO problem involves the alignment of two-dimensional
objects. While there are optimal polynomial-time algorithms for the
alignment in one-dimensional space, the problem is not tractable in
two dimensions. Here, we describe a heuristic method to obtain a twodimensional alignment of contact maps by means of a one-dimensional
alignment of their eigenvectors. Our approach uses standard techniques such
as the canonical eigendecomposition of symmetric matrices (Strang, 2003)
and the Needleman–Wunsch (NW) alignment algorithm (Needleman and
Wunsch, 1970).
The spectral theory provides conditions under which a matrix can be
decomposed into a canonical form in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
This canonical decomposition is usually called eigendecomposition or
spectral decomposition. By the spectral theorem, every real n×n symmetric
matrix M can be eigendecomposed as
M=

n


λi (vi ⊗vi )

(3)

i=1

where λi represents the i-th eigenvalue, vi the corresponding eigenvector and
⊗ denotes the outer product between vectors. The ordering of the eigenvalues
is not important provided that the eigenvectors are permuted accordingly;
thus, we can always assume that the eigenvalues are sorted in decreasing
order, i.e. λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ··· ≥ λn . Equation (3) defines matrix M as the sum of
n×n matrices vi ⊗vi , weighted by the corresponding eigenvalues λi .
The eigendecomposition allows the detection of the most relevant
information contained in a contact map. For example, in Porto et al. (2004),

Fast overlapping of protein contact maps by alignment of eigenvectors

the authors show that a contact map can be perfectly reconstructed
starting from the only knowledge of its principal eigenvector. In practice,
a contact map can be approximated by considering only few of its
eigenvectors/eigenvalues. For instance, for 1 ≤ t ≤ n, the approximation of
order t of M can be defined as
t

M̃ =
λi (vi ⊗vi )
(4)
i=1

This way of approximating a contact map is effective because the smaller
is eigenvalue λi the smaller is the contribution of matrix vi ⊗vi in Equation
(3). This is actually one of the approaches used for image data compression
(Andrews and Patterson, 1976).
Consider now two proteins P1 ,P2 with contact maps M P1 ∈
{0,1}n×n ,M P2 ∈ {0,1}m×m , respectively. For some given 1 ≤ t ≤ min{n,m},
we can heuristically compute an overlap between M P1 and M P2 by computing
an alignment that maximizes an opportune scoring function defined on their
respective t eigenvectors u1 ,...,ut and v1 ,...,vt . Since the scoring function
(1) does not penalize the eventual match of a contact with a non-contact, a
global alignment of eigenvectors is preferred to a local alignment.
The NW algorithm computes in polynomial-time the optimal global
alignment of two sequences with respect to some scoring matrix S ∈ Rn×m
and (constant) gap penalty G ∈ R. The entry Sij of the scoring matrix denotes
the level of similarity between the i-th residue of P1 and the j-th residue
of P2 . The constant value G defines the cost for the introduction of a gap in
the alignment. The NW algorithm can be easily modified in order to encode
non-constant gap penalties. In this work, we consider only constant gap
penalties. Formally, the NW algorithm computes the alignment f : R1 → R2
that maximizes the objective function

will tend to 1 with increasing of t if i,j are in contact and to
0 otherwise. In the quantity (5), the contribution of each product
(vk )i (vk )j is weighted by the corresponding eigenvalue λk . Moreover,
when λk is positive, such a contribute is positive if and only if (vk )i
and (vk )j agree in sign. We describe the i-th residue of P1 by the i-th
entries of eigenvectors v1 ,...,vt weighted by the square root of the
corresponding eigenvalue λk :


[(v 1 )i ,...,(v t )i ] = [ |λ1 |(v1 )i ,..., |λt |(vt )i ]
(6)
According to this representation, the i-th residue of P1 , described
by [(u 1 )i ,...,(u t )i ], should be matched with the j-th residue of P2 ,
described by [(v 1 )i ,...,(v t )i ], when the pairwise entries of the these
vectors highly agree both in sign and relative magnitude. The vectors
do not need to be equal to obtain a high score; for this reason, a
scoring scheme based on the Euclidean distance is not appropriate.
Experimentally, we found that the scoring function that provides the
best performances is
Sij =

t

(u k )i (v k )j

(7)

k=1

The scoring function (7) assigns high scores when the corresponding
entries of the vectors describing residues i and j have the same
sign. Moreover, in Sij the contribution of each product (u k )i (v k )j
is weighted by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalues.
(b) The gap penalty was evaluated experimentally. We found that in nearly
all cases a good choice is
G = min{0,min{Sij | 1 ≤ i ≤ n,1 ≤ j ≤ m}}

Evaluation of the running time

The experiments were run on an Intel Pentium machine with a 2.80 GHz
CPU and with 1 GB RAM. In our case, the time necessary to perform the
eigendecomposition is not included for the comparison with other methods,
since the eigenvectors can be computed (and stored) in a preprocessing phase.
In general, the eigendecomposition time depends on the map sizes but the
it is very fast compared with the time needed to perform the alignments.
Nonetheless, for sake of clarity, we include here the time necessary to perform
the eigendecomposition of the maps in our datasets described in Section 3.1.
The eigendecomposition of the Sokol dataset requires <1 ms in total. The
Lancia, Skolnick, Fischer and Proteus300 datasets require approximatively
3, 4, 14 and 55 s, respectively. The eigendecomposition of the most large
map in our datasets (534 residues) requires 2.3 s.

(a) By Equation (3), for residues i,j of protein P1 the quantity
λ1 (v1 )i (v1 )j +···+λt (vt )i (vt )j

Note that the sign of the eigenvectors has no influence in Equation (3),
i.e. vi ⊗vi = −vi ⊗−vi . In fact, there is no way to standardize the sign
of the eigenvectors in the eigendecomposition. This implies that, when
aligning two sets of t eigenvectors, we are forced to try all possible
combinations of their signs. By definition of (7), to consider all possible
combinations, it is sufficient to try all possible sign combinations for just
one set of t eigenvectors, thus producing 2t different alignments. Moreover,
in some cases, we found that, with increasing number of eigenvectors, the
quality of the alignment (in terms of the number of overlapping contacts
recovered) slightly decreases. Thus, when aligning t eigenvectors, our
algorithm proceeds as follows. First, it computes all alignments with one
eigenvector for each
pair, then with two and so on up to t. This procedure
evaluates a total of tk=1 2k = 2t+1 −2 alignments. The best alignment in
terms of overlapping contacts is chosen. One execution of the NW algorithm
costs (nm), so our algorithm costs (2t+1 ·nm), i.e. it is exponential in the
order of approximation t. Anyway, the running time is not dependent on the
contact map threshold and for values of t up to 7 the running time is small
enough to assure a fast computation, as shown below.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Comparison with exact/heuristic CMO methods

In the first test, the Al-Eigen algorithm is compared on the Skolnick
set with two exact IP-based methods, LAGR (Caprara and Lancia,
2002) and A_Purva (Andonov et al., 2008), and with the heuristic
MSVNS (Pelta et al., 2008). In Table 2, the total number of recovered
overlapping contacts (Total overlap) and the required computational
time (Time) are listed. For the sake of comparison, we use MSVNS
version 3 (as suggested by the authors) with number of restarts equal
to 5, 10, 30, 50, 70. All the runs are on the same contact maps with
threshold value set to 7.5 Å.
The implementations of LAGR and A_purva are not publicly
available and we use the data previously published as Supplementary
Material (Andonov et al., 2008). Another exact method, CMOS (Xie
and Sahinidis, 2007), available online as a web server, has limitations
on the size of the submitted problems and it was not included in our
benchmark.
As previously described (Andonov et al., 2008), the computational
time of the exact algorithms LAGR and A_purva has been limited
to a maximum of 30 min per pair of contact maps. Even under this
constraint, the two exact methods require a large computational time
(from 7 to 13 days) to compute all the 780 alignments of the Skolnick
set. It has been reported (Andonov et al., 2008) that A_purva in this
test returns an upper bound to the total overlap equal to 218 316
contacts and a total lower bound of 216 372 contacts (listed in
Table 2). This indicates that the quality of the overlaps returned
by A_purva within the time limitation is very good, since it is quite

close to the optimum solution (the distance between the total upper
bound and the total lower bound of A_purva is very short). With
A_purva, the solution is in fact <1% distant from the optimal one.
The other exact algorithm LAGR similarly returns a solution <4%
distant from the optimal one. The total overlap returned by A_purva
can, therefore, be adopted as the best approximation of the optimal
solution for the Skolnick set. Therefore, all the other solutions listed
in Table 1 are normalized to that of A_purva (%wrt A_purva).
In Table 3, the performance of Al-Eigen is compared with the
two heuristic methods MSVNS and BIMAL (Jain and Obermayer,
2009), which is not publicly available, with respect to the results
published in Jain and Obermayer (2009). The maps for Lancia
and Sokol datasets include also some contacts between contiguous
residues which are not taken into account by Al-Eigen (thus, its
performance is slightly lowered). It was not possible to compare
the performance of Al-Eigen with BIMAL on the Fischer dataset,
since the original maps used in Jain and Obermayer (2009) are not
available. In Table 4, the performance on the Fischer dataset (7.5 Å
contact maps) is compared with MSVNS only. The running times
of BIMAL and MSVNS in Table 3 are reduced with respect to that
published in Jain and Obermayer (2009) in order to take into account
the different clock frequencies: 1.75 GHz in Jain and Obermayer
(2009) and 2.8 GHz for our machine, respectively. In detail, the
running times of BIMAL and MSVNS have been scaled down by
a factor equal to 0.8, which is the minimum ratio we obtained by
comparing the running time of MSVN on our machine (on the same
maps used for the tests in Table 3) and the running time reported in
Jain and Obermayer (2009).
Summing up, heuristic algorithms, when compared with exact
algorithms, can provide good solutions in a much smaller
computational time. Interestingly enough, when the elapsed time

The comparison in Tables 3 and 4 shows that Al-Eigen has worst
performance than other heuristic methods, MSVNS and BIMAL, on
maps containing a small number of contacts. On the other hand, on
maps containing a higher number of contacts the performance of
Al-Eigen improves both in terms of quality of the overlap (compare
the results on the Lancia/Sokol datasets with those on the Skolnick
dataset) and computational time (compare the computational times
of MSVNS and Al-Eigen on the Skolinck dataset in Tables 2 and 3).

Comparison with structural alignment methods

In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm as a
classifier (the ability to recognize protein structural similarities at
the SCOP family/s.family/fold level) on the Proteus300 and Fischer
dataset. These two datasets are more computationally demanding
than the Skolnick set (they require 44 850 and 2278 alignments,
respectively) and contain non-trivial superfamilies and folds.
We compare the effectiveness of contact map alignment methods,
including MSVNS, for the structural classification task with
three structural alignment methods such as CE (Shindyalov and
Bourne, 1998), TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and DaliLite
(Holm and Park, 2000). On the Proteus300 dataset, we consider also

the performance of A_purva+sse, a variant of A_purva that encodes
secondary structure constraints (two residues can be aligned only
if they belong to the same secondary structure class). The results
shown for A_purva+sse have been taken from the Supplementary
Material of Andonov et al. (2008). The scoring function for the CMO
methods is provided by Equation (2). CE, DaliLite and TM-align
have their own scoring functions: Z-score (for CE and DaliLite) and
TM-score (for TM-align). The only pure CMO methods considered
for these tests are MSVNS and our algorithm. We use different
contact map thresholds to test the performance of our method. Due
to the demanding computational time required by MSVNS on highthreshold contact maps, it is not possible to test it for thresholds
>7.5 Å. In order to highlight the level of difficulty of our benchmarks,
we also include the performance of BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997),
so that it is easier to detect the amount of information contained in
the dataset at the protein sequence level. The performance of BLAST
is evaluated with respect to its bit-score. In detail, we perform the
following two tests.
4.2.1 Structural class recognition We check the ability to detect
the correct protein family/super family/fold with a leave-one-out
test (Tables 5 and 6). For every query-protein, we select the modelprotein in the set that obtains the best similarity score and we
measure the fraction of query-proteins for which the chosen modelprotein belongs to the same family/s.family/fold. The results on
the Proteus300 and Fischer datasets are shown in Tables 5 and 6,
respectively. On the Fischer dataset we test the performance only
at the fold level since almost 1/3 of the proteins in the dataset (22)
belong to a unique fold. In particular, the fold recognition test is
performed only on the 46 proteins that belong to a non-unique fold
in the dataset.
On the Proteus300 dataset, all the methods have similar
performance on the task of recognition at the family/s.family/fold

level. Notably, most of the errors reported in Table 5 are related
to query-proteins that belong to non-trivial folds or non-trivial
super families (see the Supplementary Material for detailed results).
For example, as can we notice in Table 5, CE and DaliLite for
3 and 1 queries, respectively, can detect the correct superfamily

but not the correct family. MSVNS and Al-Eigen (on 7.5 Å and
8 Å maps) in few cases fail to detect also the correct fold. It is
worth noticing how the family recognition performance of our
method varies at increasing values of the contact map threshold: all
queries are correctly recognized only at thresholds ≥10 Å. The good
performance of the CMO method A_purva+sse on 7.5 Å contact
maps can be related to the use of secondary structure constraints,
which can be of help in discriminating structure similarity, at least
at the SCOP class level.
As shown in Table 6, on the Fischer dataset, structural alignment
methods have better performance than CMO methods. In this case
none of the methods is able to obtain full accuracy. The differences
with respect to the results obtained on the Proteus300 dataset are
justified by the low level of similarity between the targets in the
Fischer dataset, as highlighted also by the performance of BLAST.
Most of the errors reported in Table 6 are related to queries that
have a representative only in the same superfamily but not in the
same family (Supplementary Material). In particular, the only query
misclassified by DaliLite has only one representative in the same
fold. Except for this case, the other four queries with representatives
only in the same fold class are classified correctly by all the other
methods (except BLAST). It is worth noticing that, also in this case,
the performance in fold recognition of our method increases with
increasing values of the contact threshold.
In terms of computational time, in both tests, TM-align and
Al-Eigen are the fastest.
4.2.2 Binary classification We measure the area under curve
(AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,
when the alignment scores are used as a binary classifier system at
the SCOP family/s.family/fold level. As in the previous test, the
performance on the Fischer dataset are evaluated only at the fold
level (Tables 5 and 6).
The comparison based on AUC values shows that all the
methods perform quite well as binary classifiers on both Proteus300
and Fischer datasets. In particular, the performance gap between
structural alignment and CMO methods on the Fischer dataset is
much smaller in terms of AUC values. This result indicates that, even
if almost half of the queries are misclassified by CMO comparison,
the most similar structures in the dataset are top-ranked. This test
also confirms that high-threshold contact maps are more suitable for
structure similarity detection.

4.3

Error tolerance test

In this section, we evaluate the error tolerance of Al-Eigen and
MSVNS on the Proteus300 and Fischer datasets.
In this preliminary test, we adopt two different random error
models. In particular, we apply some random perturbation to the
original contact maps and evaluate the performance in terms of
structural class recognition accuracy and AUC values, as performed
in Section 4.2. In this case, we compare a perturbed map with
all the other non-perturbed maps in the dataset, except itself. For
the sake of comparison, we use only 7.5 Å contact maps. This
threshold is also very close to the standard distance (8 Å) adopted
for contact prediction (Ezkurdia et al., 2009). In detail, we consider
the following two models for random error.
• Model 1: an amount of %x errors means that exactly n random
contacts are set to 0 and exactly n random non-contacts are set

x·C ), and C is the number of contacts in
to 1, where n =round( 100
the map. Only contacts between non-consecutive residues are
considered.

• Model 2: an amount of %x errors means that exactly n random
x (L−1)(L−2) )
entries of the map are flipped, where n =round( 100
2
and L is the length of the protein. Also in this case only
the entries of the map related to non-consecutive residues are
considered.
Error model 1 preserves the total number of contacts in the map. On
the contrary, model 2 can eventually introduce more false positive
contacts than the original number of contacts in the map. We test
error model 1 with percentage of errors equal to 70, 80 and 90%
and error model 2 with 10, 20 and 30%. In the latter case, the
perturbed contact maps contain on the average 4, 8 and 11 times more
contacts than the original ones, respectively. The results obtained on
the Proteus 300 and Fischer datasets are shown in Tables 7 and 8,
respectively.
The AUC values in Tables 7 and 8 show that the CMO comparison
approach has some discriminative power in distinguishing similar
structures also in presence of highly noisy contact maps. In
particular, the approach seems to be more robust when the total
number of contacts in noisy maps does not differ too much from
the native amount of contacts. In terms of recognition accuracy, by
comparing the results obtained on the two different datasets it is
evident that, in presence of noise (not surprisingly) the approach
is much robust in detecting similarities at the family level more
than at the fold level. In particular, on the Proteus300 dataset, the
performance of Al-Eigen are almost unaffected also for 70% errors
of type 1 (compare Tables 5 and 7).
The better performance of Al-Eigen with respect to those of
MSVNS can be related to a higher tolerance of noise due to the
eigendecomposition. In particular, we tested (data not shown) how
the two algorithms align a perturbed map with its native version.
In almost all cases the alignment computed by Al-Eigen is the
identity, i.e. the i-th residue in the perturbed map is aligned with
the i- residue in the original map. In detail, the alignments of AlEigen, on the average, have > 94% of identity (the identity abruptly
drops from 94% at 90% error to 3% at 100% error, with respect
to model 1). On the contrary, the same test on MSVN reports an
average identity <10%.

CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we described a heuristic algorithm suited to address
the CMO problem. Our algorithm computes an overlap of two
contact maps by performing a global alignment based on few
eigenvectors. The approach is effective since contact maps can be
well approximated by just a fraction of their eigenvectors. Our
algorithm is reasonably simple and, by design, its computing time
does not depend on the number of contacts in the map and then on
the contact threshold.
There are two main differences between our approach and the
other methods developed so far for the CMO problem: (i) our
algorithm is completely heuristic and it has no way to detect if the
overlap found in some point of the computation is the best possible.
In contrast, exact IP-based methods can stop the computation when
the lower and upper bounds to the optimal solution coincide. (ii) The
computing time of our algorithm depends uniquely on the protein

length and on the number of eigenvectors considered and it is not
affected by the threshold value of the contact map. Differently, for
all the other methods developed so far (exact, approximate and
heuristic), the computing time increases with increasing number of
contacts in the map (namely, with increasing threshold value of the
contact map): more contacts result into more constraints to be taken
into account and in a longer running time.
We experimentally validated the performance of our algorithm
by comparison with exact CMO methods (LAGR and A_purva),
with heuristic CMO approaches (MSVNS and BIMAL) and with
three structural alignment methods (CE, TM-align and DaliLite).
Our algorithm is fast, it has good performance in terms of quality
of the overlap when compared with exact/heuristic CMO methods
and it is also competitive with widely used structural alignment

methods in the task of protein structure comparison. In our tests,
we found that contact maps computed at thresholds values ≥10 Å
are more informative of the protein structures than those at lower
thresholds. The computational time of our method is independent
of the threshold value of the contact map and this makes it more
suitable than other CMO methods for large-scale detection of protein
structure similarities.
Finally, in this article for the first time, to the best of our
knowledge, we tested the effect of random noise on CMO
alignments. According to these tests our algorithm is quite robust to
noise and performs well in the task of structural similarity detection
also with highly perturbed contact maps, at least at the SCOP family
level.
Conflict of Interest: none declared.
