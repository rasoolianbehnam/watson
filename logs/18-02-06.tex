I have downloaded some files from 
\url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525}
there are lots of intrachromosomal data in there, corresponding
to (I think!) 11 cell lines. During the correspondense that I had
with University of Missouri (Mr. Oluwadare), he told me that I have
to used the  GM12878 data set it there, which is much larger than
the original \cite{lieberman2009comprehensive} dataset.
There are two inter- and intra-chromosomal data sets there:

\begin{enumerate}
\fontsize{13pt}{3pt}\selectfont
    \item GSE63525\_GM12878\_primary\_interchromosomal\_contact\_matrices.tar.gz\\
          GSE63525\_GM12878\_primary\_intrachromosomal\_contact\_matrices.tar.gz
      \item GSE63525\_GM12878\_combined\_interchromosomal\_contact\_matrices.tar.gz\\
          GSE63525\_GM12878\_combined\_intrachromosomal\_contact\_matrices.tar.gz
\end{enumerate}
I wonder which ones I should use at the moment.

\section*{Things to consider}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item effect of multiple pearson normalizations
    \item revised SCN algorithm
\end{enumerate}
