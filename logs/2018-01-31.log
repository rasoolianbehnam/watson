I have started comparing graphlets between chromosomes 1 of MIT and ALL.
I used the method in \cite{milenkoviae2008uncovering}.
In order to use this method, a weight needs to be assigned to each orbit.
This weight is based on a value $o_i$ that I have to calculate by hand.
For a particular orbit i, $o_i$ is the number of previous orbits that it
depends on, that is, the number of orbits that can be superimposed on
orbit $i$. I have already calculated the values for the first fourteen
orbits and they are as following:

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|llllllllllllll}
    \textbf{Orbit}          & 0& 2& 3& 4& 5& 6& 7& 8& 9& 10& 11& 12& 13& 14 \\
    \textbf{Dependencies}   & 1& 1& 2& 3& 3& 3& 3& 4& 5& 6& 7& 10& 11& 14
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
