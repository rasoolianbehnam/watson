kernel.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I have considered adaptively thresholding the HiC matrices. This 
process is inspired by the same process in image processing,
I want to use a guassian filter (F) the same size as the image itself
the values of F[i, j] are determined by theire distance from the main
diagonal of the filter. The algorithm is coded as function kern2 in
kernel.py.
